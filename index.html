                <p>A full-stack web developer is a professional who is capable of developing web applications at all
                    layers,
                    including the front-end, back-end, and database. They can work on both client-side and server-side
                    technologies to create complete web applications.

                    The front-end of a web application is the user interface that a user interacts with. A full-stack
                    developer should be proficient in front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
                    front-end
                    frameworks like React or Angular.</p>
