            <p>A full-stack web developer is a professional who is capable of developing web applications at all layers,
                including the front-end, back-end, and database. They can work on both client-side and server-side
                technologies to create complete web applications.

                developer should be proficient in front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and front-end
                frameworks like React or Angular.</p>
